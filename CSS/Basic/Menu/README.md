# Cafe Menu

This is a web page for a cafe menu, demonstrating the use of fundamental web technologies. The main goal was to practice and solidify basic **HTML** and **CSS** skills by creating a simple, structured menu page.

    * CSS selectors
    * Text properties (fonts, alignment)
    * Flexbox (for aligning menu items)

## Features
