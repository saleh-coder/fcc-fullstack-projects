# Movie Review: Eternal Horizon

A simple HTML page created to present a **movie review** using semantic structure and accessibility considerations.

## Structure

- **Title (`<h1>`)**: movie name with clear hierarchy.
- **Poster (`<img>`)**: includes descriptive `alt` text for accessibility and fixed dimensions.
- **Description (`<p>`)**: overview of the movie plot, themes, and atmosphere.
- **Rating**: visual stars (hidden from screen readers via `aria-hidden`) and numeric rating `(9.2/10)` for accessibility.
- **Cast List (`<ul>`)**: structured list of main characters and respective actors.

## Best Practices Applied

- **Semantic HTML**: use of `<main>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`.
- **Accessibility (a11y)**:
  - Descriptive `alt` text for the movie poster.
  - Numeric rating alongside visual stars for screen reader compatibility.
- **Readability**: text content formatted with clear sections for description, rating, and cast.
