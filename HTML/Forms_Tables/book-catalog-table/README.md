# Book Catalog Table

## Overview
The goal of this exercise was to practice building an HTML table using proper semantic elements.  
The table simulates a catalog of books, displaying key information such as title, author, genre, and publication year, with a footer summarizing the total number of books.

## What I Practiced
- Basic HTML structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Table elements:
  - `<table>` for wrapping the entire catalog
  - `<thead>` for column headers
  - `<tbody>` for the main content rows
  - `<tfoot>` for the summary row
- Proper use of:
  - `<tr>` (table row)
  - `<th>` (table header cells)
  - `<td>` (table data cells)
- Attributes:
  - `colspan` on `<td>` in the footer row to span across all columns
- Organizing tabular data in a readable and accessible way

## File Structure
- book-catalog-table/  
  - index.html  
  - README.md  

## Preview
To view the project locally, open `index.html` in a web browser.  
The table displays book information and a footer row showing the total number of books.
