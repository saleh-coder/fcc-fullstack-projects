# Travel Agency Page

## Overview
This project is a hands-on lab from the **Basic HTML** section of the freeCodeCamp Full Stack Developer Curriculum.

The goal was to practice core HTML elements by building a travel agency page, including headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and figure elements with links. A key learning outcome was implementing a meta description in the `<head>` to improve SEO.

## What I Practiced
### Base Structure
- Created the essential HTML skeleton with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.
- Defined language and character encoding for proper rendering and accessibility.

### Content and Semantics
- Established a clear heading hierarchy using `<h1>` and `<h2>` for semantic clarity.
- Used paragraphs `<p>` and unordered lists `<ul>` for structured content.
- Applied semantic tags `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` to link images with descriptive captions.

### Images and Links
- Added images `<img>` with meaningful `alt` attributes to improve accessibility.
- Created clickable images by nesting them inside `<a>` tags that open in a new tab (`target="_blank"`).
- Ensured all images have captions and are relevant to the content.

### SEO Optimization
- Added `<meta name="description" content="...">` in the `<head>` section to provide a concise page summary for search engines.
- Created unique and descriptive content for each page to improve search visibility.
- Used meaningful `alt` text for images to support SEO and accessibility.
