# Travel Agency Page

## Overview
Static HTML page that simulates a travel agency website.  
Built to practice semantic tags, use of images with captions, lists and basic SEO structure in the `<head>`.

## What I Practiced
- Semantic HTML (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<h1>`â€“`<h2>`)
- Paragraphs and unordered lists
- Image links wrapped in `<a>` with `target="_blank"`
- `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`
- `<meta name="description">` for better SEO

## File Structure
- index.html  
- README.md

## Preview
