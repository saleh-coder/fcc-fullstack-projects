    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>150g dark chocolate
            chopped into small pieces</li>
        <li>1 tbsp coconut oil
        </li>
        <li>2 tbsp pistachio butter</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tahini</li>
        <li>3 tbsp desiccated coconut</li>
        <li>1 tbsp pistachios
            chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the chocolate and coconut oil together in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, stirring
            until smooth. Or, do this in 30-second bursts in the microwave. Remove from the heat and cool slightly.</li>
        <li>For the filling, stir the pistachio butter, tahini and shredded coconut together in a small bowl until well
            combined – the mixture should be thick but spoonable. If it's too dry, stir in a little more pistachio
            butter.</li>
        <li>Spoon about 1 tsp melted chocolate into each of 12-16 mini silicone moulds or mini cupcake cases, tilting
            back and forth to coat the sides. Chill in the freezer for 5 mins to set slightly.</li>
        <li>Spoon a small dollop of the pistachio mixture into each chocolate-lined mould, flattening it gently using
            the back of the spoon. Top with more melted chocolate to cover the filling, then sprinkle over the chopped
            pistachios and a pinch of salt. Chill in the fridge for 20 mins until fully set.</li>
        <li>Pop the chocolates out of the moulds and serve. Will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a
            week.
