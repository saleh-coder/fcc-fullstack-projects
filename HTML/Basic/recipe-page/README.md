# Build a Recipe Page

## Overview
The objective of the exercise was to practice fundamental HTML elements to create a recipe page, including headings, paragraphs, lists, and images.

## What I Practiced
* Creating the basic structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
* Using different heading levels (`<h1>`, `<h2>`)
* Using paragraphs (`<p>`)
* Unordered and ordered lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`)
* Inserting images (`<img>`) with `src` and `alt` attributes
