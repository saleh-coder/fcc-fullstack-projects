# Mr. Whiskers' Blog Page

## Overview
The objective of this exercise is to build a semantic and structured blog page using only HTML.  
The project demonstrates proper use of semantic tags to organize content into header, navigation, main sections, multiple articles, and a footer with contact information.

## What I Practiced
- Complete semantic structure with `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>` and `<footer>`  
- Internal navigation with anchor links (`<a href="#id">`)  
- Grouping image and caption with `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`  
- Correct application of `<address>` for contact details  
- Hierarchical use of headings (`<h1>` → `<h2>` → `<h3>`)  
- Logical content segmentation into **About**, **Posts** and **Contact** sections  
- Proper use of `alt` text for accessibility  
- Separation of multiple articles within the blog feed
